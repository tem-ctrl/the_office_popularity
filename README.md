<p> In the project, the viewership, votes and IMDB ratings of the episodes are plotted to appreciate the evolution of the popularity. It turns out that the series viewership started at <strong>11.2 Million</strong> with the first episode, released on March 24, 2005. It went increasingly to the peak of <strong>22.91 Million views</strong> on episode 77, season 5 released on February 1st, 2009. After this date, the viewership per episode began to decrease steadily until <strong>3.25 Million</strong> on episode 184, season 9, released on April 25, 2013. </p>
